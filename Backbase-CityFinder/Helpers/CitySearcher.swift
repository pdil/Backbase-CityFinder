     Once the cities have been filtered according to the search term, the caller is notified

     This method also caches each search term and intelligently decides whether or not to use
     the previously used search term (or the current one) in retrieving filtered items from the cache.
     
     The caching technique results in much faster and responsive execution of searching and filtering when
     the user is quickly typing into a search field.
